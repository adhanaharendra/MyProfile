            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an enthusiastic learner with an insatiable curiosity about the world around me. While many in my generation are immersed in the fast-paced, tech-driven culture, I find myself embracing a more thoughtful and grounded approach to life. Inspired deeply by the wisdom of my elders, I strive to blend the timeless teachings they impart with my own modern experiences. <br>
                Though I wouldn’t consider myself a “tech geek,” my desire to understand and explore technology drives me forward. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I aim to expand my knowledge by delving into new areas, particularly in the realm of technology, to uncover its possibilities and potential.
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I find immense joy in playing sports—especially shooting ball, volleyball, and cricket. My love for Hindi literature often leads me to long hours of reading, where I immerse myself in the richness of language and stories. When I am home, I cherish the peaceful moments I spend in a temple located near our village’s agricultural fields, a place that brings me serenity and connection to my roots.
                <br><br>
                I deeply value the time I spend with my family and enjoy forming friendships, even with people I might not know well. I have a profound love for nature, animals, birds, and above all, humanity. These aspects of life fill me with purpose and keep me grounded in a world that is constantly changing.
